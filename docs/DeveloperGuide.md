### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the RecruitIntel data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both RecruitIntel data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

The following is an example JSON output for a person:
```json
{
    "name" : "David Li",
    "phone" : "91031282",
    "email" : "lidavid@example.com",
    "address" : "Blk 436 Serangoon Gardens Street 26, #16-43",
    "jobPosition" : "Security Specialist",
    "team" : "Apple Store",
    "notes" : "Expert in iOS security protocols and penetration testing. Previously led security at a major tech firm. Identified critical vulnerabilities in App Store submission process. Strong security mindset. Published research on mobile app security. Excellent communicator when explaining complex security concepts.",
    "tags" : [ "what", "shw" ],
    "startTime" : "2025-01-01 13:45",
    "duration" : "15"
  }
```
### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current RecruitIntel state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous RecruitIntel state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone RecruitIntel state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial RecruitIntel state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single RecruitIntel state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the RecruitIntel. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the RecruitIntel after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted RecruitIntel state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified RecruitIntel state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the RecruitIntel state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous RecruitIntel state, and restores the RecruitIntel to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the RecruitIntel to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest RecruitIntel state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the RecruitIntel, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all RecruitIntel states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire RecruitIntel.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 4
1. **Support Multiple Job Applications per Candidate**: Currently, candidates can only apply for one job position and one team at a time, which doesn't reflect real-world scenarios where candidates might be able to apply for multiple roles. We plan to enhance this by:
    * Modifying the `add` command to accept multiple job positions and teams:
      ```
      add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS j/[JOB_POSITION_1, JOB_POSITION_2] 
      tm/[TEAM_1, TEAM_2] [t/TAG]...
      ```
    * Example usage:
      ```
      add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/123 Apple Park Way 
      j/[Software Engineer, Product Manager] tm/[iOS, Product] t/Swift 
      t/UIKit t/Agile
      ```
    * Updating the UI to display multiple roles in the candidate card
    * Enhancing the `classify` command to match any of the candidate's roles:
      ```
      classify j/Software Engineer
      // Will show candidates who applied for Software Engineer, 
      // even if they applied for other roles too
      ```
    * Modifying the storage format to support arrays of job positions and teams per candidate

2. **Prevent Scheduling Interviews in the Past**: Currently, RecruitIntel allows scheduling interviews for past dates, which can lead to confusion and invalid data. We plan to enhance the interview scheduling feature by:
    * Adding date validation to ensure interview times are always in the future:
      ```
      // Current behavior
      interview 1 2023-01-01 10:00 30    // Allows scheduling in the past
      
      // Enhanced behavior
      interview 1 2023-01-01 10:00 30    
      // Error: Cannot schedule interviews in the past. The interview date 
      // must be after the current date and time
      ```
    * Implementing real-time date validation that:
        - Checks if the proposed interview date/time is at least 1 hour in the future
        - Provides helpful error messages with the current date/time for reference

3. **Enhanced Interview Sorting with Past Interview Handling**: Currently, the sort command doesn't distinguish between upcoming and past interviews, making it difficult to figure out if an interview has happened or not. We plan to enhance the sorting functionality by:
    * Adding flags to the sort command for more flexible sorting options:
      ```
      //Default: sorts all interviews
      sort 
      
      //Sorts interviews that haven't been completed first                    
      sort --nc             
      ```
    * Key behaviors:
        - sort --nc sorts upcoming interviews and places past interviews at the end, right before candidates with no interviews
        - Adds visual indicators for past interviews in the UI

4. **Improved Tag Management**: Currently, tags are completely replaced when editing, which can lead to accidental tag deletion. We plan to enhance tag management by:
    * Adding specific tag commands:
      ```
      tag 1 add t/Python        // Adds Python tag to candidate #1
      tag 1 remove t/Python     // Removes only Python tag
      tag 1 clear              // Removes all tags
      ```
    * Example usage scenarios:
      ```
      // Current behavior (using edit command)
      edit 1 t/Python          // Replaces ALL existing tags with just Python
      
      // Enhanced behavior (using new tag commands)
      tag 1 add t/Python       // Adds Python while preserving existing tags
      tag 1 remove t/Java      // Removes only Java tag, keeps others
      ```
    * Implementing tag validation:
        - Prevents duplicate tags automatically
        - Warns before removing all tags
    * Adding tag management features:
        - Group related tags (e.g., programming languages, soft skills)

5. **Enhanced Interview Command with Types**: Currently, the interview command only captures timing information without structuring the recruitment process. We plan to enhance the interview scheduling system by:
    * Adding interview type for better tracking of candidates in the recruitment process:
      ```
      //Schedule HR Interview
      interview 1 2024-03-20 14:00 60 --ty HR           
      
      //Schedule 1st Technical Interview
      interview 1 2024-03-22 10:00 90 --ty TECH --n 1   
      
      //Schedule Hiring Manager Interview
      interview 1 2024-03-25 15:00 45 --ty HM         
      ```
    * Supporting standard interview types:
      - HR: Initial screening interview
      - TECH: Technical assessment (can be numbered 1,2,...)
      - HM: Hiring manager interview
      - TEAM: Team fit discussion
      - SYS: System design interview
      - CODE: Coding assessment
      - BEHAV: Behavioral interview
      - FIN: Final round interview
      
    * Managing interview status:
      ```
      // Removes the scheduled interview for candidate #1
      interview 1 clear                
      ```
    * Adding type-based filtering:
      ```
      list interview --ty TECH   // List candidates with technical interviews
      ```

6. **Enhanced Notes Management**: Currently, notes can only be added as a single entry with limited character space. We plan to enhance the notes functionality by:
    * Adding commands for more flexible note management:
      ```
      // Adds a note entry for candidate #1
      note 1 add Great technical skills in the system design interview    
      
      // Appends some text to the 1st note
      note 1 append 1 Also showed strong team collaboration mindset        
      
      // Clears all text of the 1st note
      note 1 clear 1          
      
      // Removes the second note                                            
      note 1 remove 2                                                   
      ```
    * Supporting enhanced note features:
        - Increased character limit to 1500 characters for each note
        - Multiple note entries for each candidate
        - Timestamp for each note entry
    * Example usage:
      ```
      > note 1 add Technical Interview: Candidate showed strong Java knowledge.
      Added note #1 to John Doe
      
      > note 1 append Particularly impressed with his system design skills.
      Updated note #1 for John Doe
      
      > note 1 add Strong communication and intrapersonal skills. Involved 
      with alot of social work and clubs at university.
      Added note #2 to John Doe
      
      > note 1 list
      Notes for John Doe:
      1. Technical Interview: Candidate showed strong Java knowledge. 
      Particularly impressed with his system design skills.
      2. Strong communication and intrapersonal skills. Involved with alot 
      of social work and clubs at university.
      ```
