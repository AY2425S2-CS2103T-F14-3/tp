## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `RecruitIntel.jar` from our [releases page](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-F14-3/tp/releases).

3. Create a dedicated folder for RecruitIntel:
    * Choose a location with at least 1GB of free space
    * Ensure you have write permissions for this location
    * Copy the downloaded JAR file into this folder

4. Launch RecruitIntel:
    * Open your terminal/command prompt
    * Navigate to the folder containing the JAR file: `cd path/to/folder`
    * Run the application: `java -jar recruitintel.jar`
    * A screen similar to the one below should appear within 5 seconds:

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)


5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 j/Software Engineer tm/IOS Development` : Adds a candidate named `John Doe` applying for a `Software Engineer` position  in the `IOS Development` team.

    * `note 1 Strong backend experience, but lacks iOS exposure.` : Adds a note to the 1st candidate in the list.

    * `interview 1 2025-04-01 10:00 40` : Schedules a 40-minute interview for the 1st candidate, scheduled at 10:00 AM on April 1, 2025.

    * `sort` : Sorts the candidates by ascending order of their scheduled interview time.

    * `undo` : Reverts the most recent change (e.g. adding, deleting, or editing a candidate).

    * `clear` : Deletes all candidates.


6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Replace words in `UPPER_CASE` with the required information.
    * Example: in `add n/NAME`, replace `NAME` with the actual name like `add n/John Doe`

* Items in square brackets `[...]` are optional.
    * Example: `[t/TAG]` can be used as `t/Python` or omitted entirely

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã can be used multiple times or omitted.
    * Example: `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` allows:
        * No tags: ` `
        * One tag: `t/Python`
        * Multiple tags: `t/Python t/Java t/AWS`

* You can enter the information in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* The `sort` command only sorts **currently displayed** candidates (i.e. those shown by the last command such as `classify`, `find`, etc.).

* When using `classify` to filter candidates, it will show only candidates that match all of your search criteria.
  Example: `classify t/python tm/Design` shows candidates who have both Python skills and applied for a position in the Design team.

* For simple commands like `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`, any extra information you type will be ignored.
  Example: typing `help 123` works the same as typing just `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

**Format**:

```

Expected output: <br>
![result for help message command'](images/helpMessage.png)

### Adding a candidate: `add`

Adds a new candidate to RecruitIntel with their details and applied position.

**Format**:
```
add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS j/JOB_POSITION_APPLIED 
tm/TEAM_APPLIED [t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã
```

**Key behaviors**:
* All details except tags are mandatory
* A candidate is considered a duplicate if they share the same email as an existing candidate.
* Email must follow these rules:
    - Before @: Must start/end with letters/numbers and can contain (+, ., -) in between
    - After @: Must contain at least two parts (e.g., example.com) and each part can only use letters, numbers, and hyphens
    - Case sensitivity: Emails are case-insensitive (e.g., John@EXAMPLE.com equals john@example.com)
* Each candidate can only apply to one job position and one team at a time

**Examples**:
* Adding an iOS developer:
  ```
  add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/123 Apple Park Way 
  j/Software Engineer tm/iOS Development t/Swift t/UIKit
  ```
* Adding a chip designer:
  ```
  add n/Jane Smith p/91234567 e/janes@example.com a/456 Infinite Loop 
  j/Hardware Engineer tm/Chip Design t/Verilog t/ASIC
  ```

üí° **Tips**:
* Use meaningful tags to track candidate skills and experiences
* Add multiple tags to make classification easier later on

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**:
* Tags cannot contain spaces - use hyphens instead if needed (e.g., use machine-learning and not machine learning)

4. Contact support if issues persist

**Q**: Why does my `classify` command return no results?
**A**: This could happen for several reasons:
1. Your search criteria might be too specific - try removing some filters
2. The tags or team names might be misspelled - check for typos
3. The candidates might not have all the specified attributes - try searching with fewer criteria

**Q**: Why can't I schedule an interview for a specific time?
**A**: Check these potential issues:
1. Ensure the date format is correct (YYYY-MM-DD)
2. Verify the time is in 24-hour format
3. Make sure the duration is a multiple of 5 minutes

## Known Issues

1. **Multiple Screen Display Issue**
    * **Problem**: Screen may open off-screen when switching from multiple to single screen
    * **Solution**: Delete `preferences.json` and run the application again
    * **Prevention**: Close application before changing display setup

2. **Help Window Behavior**
    * **Problem**: Minimized Help Window doesn't respond to help command. The Help Window remains minimized
    * **Solution**: Manually restore the minimized Help Window
    * **Workaround**: Close and reopen application

3. **Complex Command Formatting**
    * **Problem**: Commands with multiple tags or long addresses might be difficult to format correctly
    * **Solution**: Break down complex commands into smaller steps
    * **Example**: Instead of adding all tags at once, use `edit` to add tags gradually
    * **Prevention**: Use the `help` command to verify command format before execution

4. **Data File Corruption**
    * **Problem**: Application fails to start or behaves unexpectedly after manual data file edits
    * **Solution**: Restore from backup or start with a fresh data file
